thanks very much mate!
hello everybody

Hi all... I've noticed that my system no longer plays a shutdown sound when I turn off the PC anymore... did they change that with 8.04?
maybe you have it disabled? or your speakers are muted?
"those were my first two thoughts... no to both, all other sounds are fine on my system."
why does it happen?
bazhang : I usually try again later :)
"nope, no bid deal"

why isn't nvidia-xconfig in the synaptic packet manager list?
You mean nvidia-settings?
"If you installed nvidia-glx, then you have nvidia-settings and nvidia-xconfig as they are part of the nvidia-glx package"
does anyone know what might be causing any 3D app to use almost all the cpu and make the whole system lag w/ xorg's ati driver? glxinfo shows it's configured right.
It might be due to the fact that ATi made your gfx card </flamebait>
"I agree I like nvidia's better, but it's a laptop. :P"
I've tried to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure vmware-server but it errors saying the package is broken or hasnt been installed correctly

"I think I'm gonna quit gentoo for ubuntu on my ibook ......... hoary seems a good desktop os, only the lack of java scares me. also, is it possible to install apache + php on ubuntu (using ubuntu packages I mean)"
should be pretty similar i guess
/etc/resolv.conf is generated by scripts under /etc/resolconf/. The 'search' entry is created by /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc
"ok, ty, how can I use that to modify 'search'?"
You can create '/etc/default/resolvconf' and add specific variables to it which will be used by that script to set 'search'
"Is SAMBA installed by default or do I need to install it, if so what command do I use in terminal to install it."

How do you edit /etc/fstab so that any user can mount and umount a hdd?

hi guys can you please tell how to install (tar.gz) file in ubuntu
First of all you need to unpack the tarball and read the INSTALL and README files in it
"It's a tarball, extract is all you can do with it."
or killall -9 vlc
but thats lazy hehe
what does the -9 do?
"Ok I got the i686 9.04 installed on a usb hdd. It boots on every computer I have put it on. The 3d acceleration is not on. If I installed the nvidia drivers for my home pc to get 3d acceleration working, but then use the hdd to boot up in anther pc that has a intel or ati card will the 2d grapichs work like in the live cd? Can I install ati nvidia and intel drivers so I will have 3d acceleration on any pc I use it on?"
not really.  The driver has to be selected in the xorg configuration file and loaded at the start of X for acceleration.  You would have to also change this file ever time you booted to a machine with a different video card.
yes.  I have a stick I have that same setup on.  I avoid any support of ATI like the plague.
"when my wine app (diablo 2 and world of warcraft) loses focus (alt+tab, ubuntu update pops up, sometimes the screensaver), it mostly gets stuck and i can't even get back to it to exit properly. what can i do to resume them? until now i did xkill or even hard-reset. (using ubuntu 12.04)"
"fullscreen wine apps sometimes have weird behavior... although this is an ubuntu question, perhaps folks at #winehq will be able to assist you better in this"
"because this is very tied with that particular game, and your video settings... and they have way more knowledge in its particularities than us"

thanks!
what setting did you edit in /etc/default/grub?
"apparently, grub2 disables your ability to hide the menu if you have more than one os; this thread describes how to edit the grub os prober to disable this behavior http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1287602"
"awesome, that's exactly what i'm experiencing - would never have guessed that was the triggering circumstance, thanks!"

I'm having a few problems with resolutions on Ubuntu 8.04. My graphics card is an MX440 and allowed me to display 1280x1024 previously on Fedora however with ubuntu it seems to refuse to want to pick up any resolutions higher then 800x600. I've tried a reconfigure of xserver-xorg but it didn't ask me anything about resolutions and then I've edited the xorg.conf file to no result. Are there any further problems that I should be aware of?
